### Create a developer account

I asked ChatGPT to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3d14453c-8035-4ef9-ac47-5fda02f694bd">explain</a> how to get a developer account. 

### How to

First, create a localStorage value containing your api key:

In the console enter: `localStorage.chatApiKey = "the text of your actual api key"`

Click here to run the app.

### What you'll see

### User note

This is really fun because it doesn't know who Bull Mancuso is, or at least not yet. And it keeps getting it wrong. I've heard he was with The Sopranos, Godfather and Dick Tracy so far. :smile:
