A browser-based JavaScript app that finds out who Bull Mancuso is.

### Create a developer account

I asked ChatGPT to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3d14453c-8035-4ef9-ac47-5fda02f694bd">explain</a> how to get a developer account and api key. 

### How to

You can run the app from my server, <a href="http://scripting.com/code/chatgpthelloworld/index.html#">here</a>. 

It will fail the first time, then open the console and enter this:

`localStorage.chatApiKey = "the text of your actual api key"`

Reload the page and this time it should work.

### What you'll see

You should see something <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/09/whoIsBull.png">like this</a>. 

I've gotten a bunch of different answers, including it doesn't know <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Bull+Mancuso%22">who</a> Bull Mancuso is. 

### Podcast

I recorded a <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/08/09/myFirstChatgptApp.html">4-minute podcast</a> about this little project.
